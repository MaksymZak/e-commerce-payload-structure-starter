I'm building an educational e-commerce demo app to teach data access patterns in Payload CMS. Please read the CLAUDE.md file for full context.

Let's start methodically:

STEP 1: Project Setup

- Review the CLAUDE.md file and confirm you understand the goals
- Create the essential folders and basic configuration
- Don't implement any data access patterns yet - just get the foundation ready

After this step, I want to review the structure before moving to the next phase.

What questions do you have about the project goals, and what's your plan for the initial setup?
